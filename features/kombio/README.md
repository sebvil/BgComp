Kombio is a 2-6-player game.

It can be played in two ways:

1. Up to n rounds: whoever has the least number of points at the end of n rounds wins.
2. Up to n points. You can add a "re-entry" option to the game, so that players can play again after losing, as long as
   there are at least two more players still in the game. Players re-enter the game with the highest score of all
   remaining players in the game. There are two variations:
    1. Whenever someone exceeds n points, the game is over.
    2. The last player to reach n points wins.

During each round, one player will call "Kombio". If a player runs out of cards, it counts as if they called "Kombio".
Points are then given in the following way:

1. Everyone gets the points of the cards on their hand.
2. If the player who called "Kombio" has the lowest score, without tying, everyone else gets 10 extra points. Otherwise,
   the player who called "Kombio" gets 15 extra points.
